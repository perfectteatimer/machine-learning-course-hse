# Machine Learning course-hse
A repository with practical tasks of the specialization course machine learning and an application(HSE) that covers the basics of classical machine learning. There may be some issues in the code.

### Overview of Projects  

#### **Linreg**  
- Analysis of data and feature engineering.  
- Data visualization and working with `scikit-learn`.  
- Fitting and predicting with real datasets.  

#### **Gradient Descent**  
- Implementation of various gradient descent methods in `descents.py`.  
- Linear regression training using these methods in `linear_regression.py`.  
- Understanding optimization algorithms through hands-on implementation.  

#### **Linear Classification**  
- Classification metrics and model evaluation.  
- Exploration of SVM and logistic regression.  
- Probability calibration, feature transformation, and selection.  
- Multi-class classification and a near real-world business case.  

#### **Trees**  
- Decision trees from `scikit-learn` for classification and hyperparameter analysis.  
- Implementation of a custom decision tree for classification.  
- A regression tree with linear models in the leaf nodes.  

#### **Boosting**  
- Custom implementation of gradient boosting.  
- Exploration of optimization techniques for boosting.  
- Experiments with the capabilities of boosting algorithms.
